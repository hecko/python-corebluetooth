Sample source for CoreBlutooth via PyObjC(Python)
====

#Overview

## Description

 This sample source code is writing in how to implementation BLE application using python on OSX.
 It is using CoreBluetooth Library via [PyObjC](https://pythonhosted.org/pyobjc/).
 Target BLE device is [2JCIE-BL01 OMRON Enviroment sensor](http://www.omron.co.jp/ecb/products/sensor/special/environmentsensor/).
 The sensor provid some sensor data throw BLE interface.(see below table)

|Sensor name|unit|
|:----|:----|
|Templature|degree celsius|
